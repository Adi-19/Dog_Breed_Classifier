# Dog_Breed_Classifier
First we are using Convolutional Neural Networks for predication of dog.


In the second approch we are using Transfer learning for predication.In transfer we are using VGG16 model to train.

Step 1: Import Datasets

Step 2: Detect Humans

Step 3: Detect Dogs

Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
