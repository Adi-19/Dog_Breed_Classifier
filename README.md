# Dog_Breed_Classifier

# Overview
Built a pipeline involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can be used to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of its breed. If supplied with an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
First we are using Convolutional Neural Networks for predication of dog.


In the second approch we are using Transfer learning for predication.In transfer we are using VGG16 model to train.

Step 1: Import Datasets

Step 2: Detect Humans

Step 3: Detect Dogs

Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
